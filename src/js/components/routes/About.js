                Just a "Girl Dad" trying to work, provide, and maintain. In my spare time I like to dabble in game development. 
                Some of my javascript games can be found here or on my github. I love the game of basketball and enjoy watching some NBA games. 
                I don't follow full teams, but my favorite player is Kevin Durant. All respect to Lebron James and MJ, but Steph Curry is my G.O.A.T.
            </p>
