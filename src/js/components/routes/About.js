                    Hello, World! My name is Taylor, and I am hard working and self motivated .NET developer with a desire to learn. I have 8+ years of industry experience in WebAPI/MVC app development. I also dabble in web development primarily using ReactJS (or vanilla javascript). Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, game development and cooking. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I am always looking for an opportunity to partner with other devs and tech thinkers; so drop a line if you want to collaborate.
