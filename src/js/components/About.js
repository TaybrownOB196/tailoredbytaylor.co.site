                Hello, World! My name is Taylor, and I am hard working and self motivated individual
                with a desire to learn. I also think it is extremely important to reach back and feed the future. I am a software developer by profession 
                and hobby as well. At work I swap between frontend to backend development, but in my 
                spare time I like to dabble in game development. I love the game of basketball and enjoy 
                watching the NBA. As a Detroit native, I can't rely on the Pistons so I just follow whichever team my favorite player 
                (in Kevin Durant) is playing for. I also love to play whenever I get the free time.
            </p>
